/**
 * Example Vite configuration for using nl-search in a browser environment
 * 
 * Starting from nl-search v1.1.0, the package uses browser-native NLP libraries
 * (compromise and @skyra/jaro-winkler) with no Node.js-specific dependencies.
 * 
 * No special Vite configuration is needed! This file is kept for reference only.
 * The package works out of the box with Vite, Webpack, Rollup, and other bundlers.
